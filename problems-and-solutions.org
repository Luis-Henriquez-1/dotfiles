This file is for documenting differences between observed and expected behavior
as well as the solution to those problems.

* BUG cursor was hollow during after install :cursor:display:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2bb789c2-ca61-401b-b2ae-94e4891765ff
:END:

After first installing.

* BUG key-chord-mode not being enabled :startup:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       37386985-e160-4f96-b5d7-de9689b26157
:END:
=key-chord-mode= should be enabled after the either =evil-insert-state= or
=evil-emacs-state= is entered as I [[][specify in its use-package form] However, it
was not enabled yet.

* terminal gui Emacs cannot see the font :font:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e4eeba57-fd52-4203-887a-68c0734567b4
:END:

So I found out that since the frame has never been created, terminal Emacs can't
see the font. Looks like I'll need some script to get it?

* poppler not working on guix :guix:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       10e01ab4-b8cb-45fb-b687-f9b2451e5a21
:END:

* org-mode needs to be restarted sometimes :org:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a6caeed6-34fb-4b82-8b51-485265474446
:END:

After modifying the header args org-mode needs to be restarted so the new
changes can take effect. I realized this after I had changed the tangle target
of an org file to something else and realized.

* how to trigger prompt for pinentry :emacs:gpg:pinentry:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       83466e70-ba4b-4e1a-b2a6-4a0fd5e18e87
:END:

I setup git so that I sign all of my commits with my gpg key. However, magit
does not prompt me for my gpg key when it needs it. I have been getting around
this by using [[][password-store-copy] from [[][pass] to induce a gpg prompt.

* do I need both =/usr/bin/pinentry-emacs= and [[][emacs-pinentry] package? :gpg:pinentry:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a752ecc7-3761-44d7-b98e-0d5f8e2d812b
:END:

* create =org-babel-tangle-subtree= :org:tangle:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c7386043-ffe3-4d2d-9d56-3403c0324699
:END:

I often end up having to narrow the buffer to the subtree and then tangle. It
would be faster if I had a function that did those steps for me.

* generate a buffer of headings that I look up by tags :org:transclusion:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       96bd6106-e9e9-4c6e-b5df-a557b07c2fff
:END:

A desire of mine has been to be able to search for content via headline tags.
Obviously, in my case this would yield very powerful searches because virtually
all of my dotfiles are in org-mode and contain tags. More specifically, when
searching for headline tags I want to generate a buffer that contains all the
headlines which match the tags I searched for. Also, when I edit any of those
headlines, the original org buffers that contains those headlines are edited as
well. This is a form of [[][transclusion].

The searching part is already done well by [[][org-ql].

* how do I deal with multiple OSes? :os:dotfiles:org:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93f4f4de-09ee-48d5-93f4-22746ef3542d
:END:

I still need to work out how my dotfiles will elegantly and robustly handle
multiple operating systems. Right now it assumes arch. I have some ideas.

* removing excessive tags :org:tag:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       39d7b36f-b92a-4682-ad0b-bc6ba5026e61
:END:

I'd like to write a function that remove any unnecessary tags from an org file.

* definitive way for adding links :org:links:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2bdbc233-f4e9-432c-b5fa-70a78b974906
:END:

* investigation on destructuring
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       54546f11-6e78-48e3-9efd-c92b74c37cff
:END:

I eventually want to come up with a solution to adding features such as
=one-or-more= and =optional= to pcase destructuring. Additionally, I want to see
whether its possible to use a much friendlier syntax to pcases, and just convert
to it in the background.

** pcase-lambda work with logical
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b419b5f4-b739-4420-9c7c-265a8cf4b170
:END:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(pcase-lambda (`(,(and (pred stringp) ,it))))
#+end_src

** pcase!
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cceb8e3f-8b0b-4551-91d3-27e24f4ba1c7
:END:

This is a prototype wrapper around the built-in pcase macro that tries to
provide better syntax than pcase and add more logical.

* TODO creating a reference for headline at point
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0a729a62-88f4-4993-bdf7-30db09354c12
:END:

This headline contains the logic for creating a reference. A reference will
consist of two parts. One is. One is a property on the headline whose value is a
link.

** parse file
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6bc2f3f0-df67-4e8d-9a48-56f7b5cc61bf
:END:

** main function
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a0dfdc42-fd08-4ca6-a36d-35d877b6c845
:END:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-create-reference ()
  "Creates a reference to a headline."
  (interactive)
  (let ((headline (org-ml-parse-headline-at (point)))
	(reference-buffer (org-ml-parse-this-buffer)))
    (if (not (has-reference-property-p headline))
	(add-reference-property headline))))
#+end_src
