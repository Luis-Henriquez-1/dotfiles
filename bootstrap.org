The purpose of this file is to boostrap my Emacs config. More specifically, it's
the file that's evaluated that contains the instructions for how to bootstrap my
Emacs config.

To bootstrap my dotfiles run ~emacs --script bootstrap.sh~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
(require 'rx)
(require 'subr-x)
#+end_src

* make sure that I can evaluate source blocks
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

By default org blocks make you confirm before evaluating them. If we don't want
to be promted for evaluating every source block--and, trust me, we don't--then
we should disable this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+end_src

* other settings
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       692bf002-24b5-4e51-bb8c-fea4c578cdfb
:END:

These settings ensure that creating non-existent directories is on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

:END:

I conservatively just tangle the Emacs stuff and leave it to myself to do the
rest in an Emacs session. As I accrue more knowledge on bootstrapping I'll
change this so that I can provide myself options for what I want to do. For this
I need to research how to prompt in the shell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun boostrap-emacs ()
  "Bootstrap emacs."
  ;; Download needed packages.
  (xl-install-packages)
  )
#+end_src

* main function
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

This function is called when.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun main ()
  "Do the right thing based on the command line args."
  (bootstrap:build-emacs)
  )
#+end_src
