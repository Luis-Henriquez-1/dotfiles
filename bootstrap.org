The purpose of this file is to boostrap my Emacs config. More specifically, it's
the file that's evaluated that contains the instructions for how to bootstrap my
Emacs config.

* load org-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c82d1f3f-ac39-492d-b7c8-b1bb7f6b80c7
:END:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
#+end_src

* load the library of babel
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f6238cb4-9b85-49ef-baf3-eb63e7dbc0c5
:END:

The library of babel is what contains extensions that I've written to org-mode
as well as things that are better done during tangling (for performance reasons)
such as.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ob-lob)
(org-babel-lob-ingest "library-of-babel.org")
#+end_src

* tangle emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6bfe2d01-e068-4650-9f3e-4e4ddfc2f4a6
:END:

I conservatively just tangle the Emacs stuff and leave it to myself to do the
rest in an Emacs session. As I accrue more knowledge on bootstrapping I'll
change this so that I can provide myself options for what I want to do. For this
I need to research how to prompt in the shell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-tangle "")
#+end_src
