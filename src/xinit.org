* starting org on guix

I'm am not keen on paying the cost of starting a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Manager#Console][login manager]] at startup. I
don't see a great benefit to having a graphical login manager and I prefer the
flexibility of being able to use the command line before initializing a
graphical display.

Right now, shepard is admittedly rather slow in starting up. It's even slower
when it has to begin a display manager.

So below I implement the advice given in [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-guix/2018-07/msg00080.html][this email]] to create a command that can
run =xorg= in guix. When I log in I run =sh xinit.sh= to start xorg.

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

DIR=$HOME/.guix-profile

$DIR/bin/xinit -- $DIR/bin/Xorg :0 vt1 -keeptty \
	       -configdir $DIR/share/X11/xorg.conf.d \
	       -modulepath $DIR/lib/xorg/modules
#+end_src
