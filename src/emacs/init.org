Emacs by default uses dynamic binding. Lexical binding is a [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][known way to boost
startup speed]]. To enable it you add the following [[info:elisp#Using Lexical Binding][buffer-local variable]] on the
top of your elisp file.

This headline sets up package management and defines the fundamental functions
and macros I use for the rest of my configuration.

** config files and directores
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       be8993d3-c8f7-451b-8cb4-04a9138e5c4e
:END:

It's useful to store directories which I reference frequently in variables and
functions. This way I can reference the full path. Certain directories are
important; and I end up referencing them alot.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvaralias 'XL-INIT-FILE 'user-init-file)

(defvaralias 'XL-EMACS-DIR 'user-emacs-directory)

(defconst XL-README-FILE (expand-file-name "README.org" "~/")
  "README file from which all other files are tangled.")

(defconst XL-LOCAL-DIR (concat XL-EMACS-DIR ".local/")
  "Directory where I store files that need to exist, but I don't want to see.")

(defconst XL-CACHE-DIR (concat XL-LOCAL-DIR "cache/")
  "Directory where I store files used for caching information.")

(defconst XL-RECIPE-FILE (concat XL-EMACS-DIR "recipes.el")

** package management
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       00eaa1a5-b5fe-437d-9888-1846ea9a232b
:END:

The goal I have with package management is to deal with it all in this headline.
All package installation should happen here so that later we can use focus on
configuring packages, pretending like all the packages I'm are built-in to Emacs.

**** straight
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2e251cc7-04de-43f8-a31f-1574a54ad576
:END:

[[straight][straight.el]] is a package manager that installs packages by cloning their git
repositories from online and building them from source. A consequence of this is
that you have the history of every installed emacs package locally. Another
consequence is that you can completely reproduce the state of your emacs on
another machine by installing the same packages with the same versions.

We don't need to clone everything from the git repos. Setting the depth to one
conserves some disk space.

:END:

To save startup time, we don't want to load packages unnecessarily. Many
packages have what I like to call (I just made this up :smirk-cat:) "entry-points", or
commands that are used to trigger the loading of the package. =straight=
optionally handles this for us.

By "integration" this variable means that it disables =package.el='s
initialization. We don't need =straight= to do this for us because it is handled in
[[id][early-init]].

I got the inspiration of cloning straight's repo (as opposed to just using the
[[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#bootstrapping-straightel][bootstrap code]]) from [[https://github.com/kinnala/diy-emacs][diy-emacs]].

:END:

One of the goals is to be able to completely reproduce my Emacs configuration.
To do this I store the recipes of all the package I install in [[helpvar:XL-RECIPE-FILE][XL-RECIPES-FILE]].
Upon startup I read this file and register all the recipes in it with =straight=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-read-recipes ()

Perhaps, in the future I could figure out preciesly how straight generates its
load paths and generate them without actually needing to call straight. The
advantage of doing it this way is that it is fool-proof.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-generate-package-paths ()

I could just use the side-effect of [[helpfn:straight-use-package][straight-use-package]] to fill up the
[[helpvar:load-path][load-path]]. However, I eventually want to compile this step away in the style of
[[https://github.com/nilcons/emacs-use-package-fast][emacs-use-package-fast]].

I need a way to update the recipe file based on packages I have installed. Right
now I the file will be updated with the packages I choose to install with
straight. In the future I want more fine grained control, perhaps showing me the
difference between the packages I installed in my current Emacs session compared
with the last and allowing me to choose which ones to add.

** library
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       70af1291-6b16-4261-ba83-19bb16d0023e
:END:

This headline contains all the the helper functions and macros I defined for
customizing Emacs. The main thing that's done in an Emacs configuration is
configuring packages, both built-in packages and external packages. And in this
process, there are often packages that augment and aid in the configuration of
other packages. Additionally, if you care about startup time it's important to
make sure packages are only loaded when they need to be. The major purpose of
this library is to provide me the tools to configure these packages in a way
that is concise and efficient.

*** custom helpers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cfa16796-a4fe-4e2a-a021-fb9891950556

These are tools that are specifically designed to help me write macros.

**** symbols

Conversion between symbols, keywords, and strings are prevalent in
macro-writing.

***** symbol intern
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       06bfc6f7-4c51-44e7-b32e-1434a602b55b
:END:

This is a convenience function for quickly banging out a custom symbol. It's
advantage over just plain [[helpfn:intern][intern]] is that it will coerce its arguments to a
symbol. This is useful when writing macros where it is a common occurance to
have a mix of different objects (usually strings and symbols) that you want to
put together into one symbol. This function is meant to just do what I mean.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-symbol-intern (&rest args)
  "Return ARGS as a symbol."
  (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t))
  (intern (apply #'xl-to-string args)))

***** keyword intern
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0618b8d7-e0a4-4e3e-8d89-b7d0ebe43917
:END:

Sometimes I want to create a keyword by interning a string or a symbol. This
commands saves me having to add the colon at the beginning before interning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-keyword-intern (&rest args)
  "Return ARGS as a keyword."
  (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t))
  (apply #'xl-symbol-intern ":" args))

***** keyword name
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e853603a-851d-429f-9201-f2e93734dfaf
:END:

Calling [[helpfn:symbol-name][symbol-name]] on a keyword returns the keyword as a string. However,
sometimes we don't want the prepended colon on they keyword. This function is
for that occasion.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-keyword-name (keyword)
  "Return the name of the KEYWORD without the prepended `:'."
  (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t))
  (substring-no-properties (xl-to-string keyword) 1))
#+end_src

***** convert to string
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       60f22f98-8204-45ae-9943-f19cdfe60459
:END:

This function is for converting something to a string, no questions
asked. Similar to [[id:06bfc6f7-4c51-44e7-b32e-1434a602b55b][xl-symbol-intern]], I use it when I don't want to be bothered
with details and just want a string.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-to-string (&rest args)
  "Return ARGS as a string."
  (declare (pure t) (side-effect-free t))
  (with-output-to-string

***** detect emacs symbols

:ID:       207ed522-51f3-45e7-91ba-8afb828d950b
:END:

These headline contains functions to detect particular Emacs symbols. Certain
Emacs symbols follow a convention. For example, most hooks end with the suffics
=-hook=. It may be useful--particularly in macros--to know what kind of symbol
we're dealing with. And, it may also be useful to be able to convert a normal
symbol (by which I mean one that doesn't follow the conventions) to one of these
particular kinds.

**** quoting
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       95a2271b-a21b-4fed-a6b8-1e76ca821ed4
:END:

This headline deals with utility functions for dealing it quotes. A quote is a
special form in lisp that is ued to indicate that a symbol or an expression
should not be evaluted. The quotes are so prevalent in lisp that they each have
a character that's used to abbreviate them as I will explain.

The purpose of this headline is to provide functions that are useful for macro
writing. What we deal with when writing macro is syntax itself.

***** single-quoted
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       533945fc-c700-42ce-8b93-d6bd9e16d9c7
:END:

A single quote prevents the evaluation of a symbol so that lisp reads the symbol
as syntax instead of evaluating it for its value. I should not that the ='= is
just how emacs displays a quote for brevity. In reality something like ~'cat~ is
~(quote cat)~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun xl-single-quoted-p (obj)

***** sharp-quoted

:ID:       6ba0980e-4391-47ef-a555-4c1dc3132f3b
:END:

A sharp quote is visually represented as =#'=. The real lisp representation of
this is =(function)=. So a ~#'foo~ would be ~(function foo)~. =function= is the
same as =quote= except the former tells the compiler you're referring to the
function symbol.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** macro keyword arguments

:ID:       dc7a63e6-041b-4855-b206-6d72ef732de1
:END:

Following past examples (such as that of), I initially opted for allowing
keyword arguments in the "function args" part of defun-like macros. This is fine
when there's only one keyword argument, but any more and it starts to get
crowded. It doesn't help that emacs functions tend towards longer names due to a
lack of namespaces. Therefore, I support keyword args in the function body.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Sometimes I want to know whether something is a list and not a cons
cell. Usually, this happens when I want to know whether I can loop over
something--you can loop over a list but not a cons cell.

When writing macros in lisp it is not uncommon to need to write a macro that can
nest a form within some number of other forms (for an example, see [[id][after!]]). This
macro makes this problem much easier.

The original idea for this macro came from [[https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/iterate/iterate/-/blob/master/iterate.lisp][iter's source code]].

Anaphora refers to the ability to refer to. I have decided it is best to use
=<>= to denote the symbol referred to by anaphoric macros because it is easy to
type (assuming parentheses completion), because such a symbol uncommon in lisp.
A key advantage to this is that there is a consistent "syntax" for anaphoric
variables as opposed to using =it=. A consequence of this is that you have more
flexibility to name variables. Additionally, I like that it looks like a slot or
placeholder.

**** eval a form in a string
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       79cfc39a-0924-468b-9fbc-83388323a39b
:END:

Sometimes it is useful to evaluate a lisp form that's in a string. One example,
is when [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-Code-Blocks.html#Evaluating-Code-Blocks][evaluating code in source blocks]]. In general, this comes up
whenever you have to evaluate code you've gotten from a buffer.

You may be wondering why I first wrapped the form in the string with a [[helpfn:progn][progn]]
form. The reason is that [[helpfn:read-from-string][read-from-string]] only takes reads one from from a
string at a time.

This function came from [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/19877/how-to-evaluate-elisp-code-contained-in-a-string][this stackexchange question]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

:END:

=after!= is yet another wrapper around == that can accept multiple features or
even a specification of features using =and= or =or=.

The reason that we check for the feature is to prevent [[hvar:eval-after-load][eval-after-load]] from
polluting the [[hvar:after-load-list][after-load-list]]. =eval-after-load= adds an entry to
=after-load-list= whether or not it has been loaded.

We intentionally avoid with-eval-after-load to prevent eager macro expansion
from pulling (or failing to pull) in autoloaded macros/features.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro after! (features &rest body)
  "Wrapper around `with-eval-after-load'."
  (declare (indent defun) (debug t))

Emacs is for the most part operating system agnostic. Packages written in elisp

settings that should favors particular operating systems over others.

=eval-after-load= is a macro that evaluates a lisp form after a file or feature
has been loaded. It's syntax is a bit terse because you need to quote the
feature as well as the form to be evaluated.

Also, if an =eval-after-load= block contains an error and it is triggered by a
feature, the error will happening. I think it might be that because the form was
not successfully evaluated =eval-after-load= does not realize it should stop
loading it. To remedy this I wrap the block with [[helpfn:condition-case][condition-case]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro eval-after-load! (feature &rest body)
  "A wrapper around `eval-after-load!' with error catching."
  (declare (indent defun))
  `(eval-after-load ',feature
     '(condition-case error

        (error
         (message "Error in `eval-after-load': %S" error)))))
#+end_src

**** set!

One "gotcha" in Emacs is the existence of custom variables. Unlike typical
variables custom variables sometimes rely on certain code being executed when
they're initialized or when their values are changed. If you just set the
variable normally with [[helpfn:setq][setq]] you'd change it's value but you wouldn't be running
it's corresponding code so the change you think would happen, might not happen
at all.

Rather than keeping track of which variables have custom setters and which do
not, I opt to just use this macro.

For this reason I use =set!= as a replacement for =setq=.

[[https://opensource.com/article/20/3/variables-emacs][This article]] provides a brilliant synopsis of emacs variables.

Note that I may depreciate this in favor of setf.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

	,@(loopy (cons (sym val . _) args #'cddr)

This is a macro for writing anaphoric lambdas. It is based on [[https://github.com/troyp/fn.el][fn]], the main
difference being that in a few special cases you can specify a named anaphoric
variable. Also, I don't support the alternate =fn:= syntax.

Finally, we get to use =use-package= to configure itself! :smile: By default,
=use-package= provides its own messages and error handling. This can make the
macro expansion of a =use-package= form crowded and much more difficult to
read. Setting [[helpvar:use-package-expand-minimally][use-package-expand-minimally]] tells =use-package=.

By default =use-package= loads a package immediately. Setting
[[helpvar:use-package-always-defer][use-package-always-defer]] tells =use-package= not to load it unless I explicitly
request it (for example, with the =:demand= keyword).

Packages don't live in an isolated enviroment. Often one package depends on one
or more packages. Sometimes, I add customizations to a package using certain
libraries and then I need to load them when that package is loaded. The purpose
of this keyword is to load a package when a certain function is called.

:END:

These are packages that I use to make writing lisp code more convenient. Emacs
Lisp is a full-featured, turing-complete language. However, for some data
structures like hash-tables and alists it is missing consistently named
functions for performing operations on these data structures. This is improving
slowly with the introduction of libraries like =seq.el= and =map.el= but still
leaves much to be desired. This sounds like a complaint, but it actually
highlights the advantage of the extensibility of Emacs.

**** shut-up
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       71681f9f-2760-4cee-95a0-4aeb71191a42

This package provides a macro named =shut-up= that as its name suggests,
silences output of any forms within it :speak-no-evil:. Emacs itself and many
emacs packages spew messages. While I can see how in certain circumstances there
messages can be useful, most of the time they are superfluous.

**** dash

:END:

Dash is rich list manipulation library. Many of the functions it have already
been found in some form or another in emacs in features such as =cl-lib= and
=seq= and =subr=, but dash has some very convenient functions and macros over
emacs (such as =-let)=. Moreover, a lot of work has been put into making it's
functions efficient; some are even more efficient than built-in cl
functions. Additionally, it's already used as a dependency of very many packages
so I'll likely end up loading it anyway.

=dash-functional= provides "function combinators". These are functions that take
one or more functions as arguments and return a function. One example of this is

**** loopy

:ID:       1c30099a-86b4-41f9-8390-e9e3c20b0257
:END:

=loopy= is an alternative to =cl-loop= that preserves lisp structure. It is akin
to [[https://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/][Common Lisp's iter]]. dash's functions and macros are good for most
cases. But they are not as good in my opinion when you're dealing with a complex
loop that involves accumulating several variables or atypical control-flow (as
in, break statements or return statements). This is where =loopy= comes into
play.

I thought I'd be using this macro exclusively and that I'd never use =loopy= at
all. However, =loopy= has the distinct advantage that it has more freedom to
name its clauses without clobbering them with existing Emacs functions. So I'd
say I use =loopy= when the loop doesn't need.

For the same drawback as I've mentioned, =loopy-iter= can't use the =list=
clause because it would get confused with it and the built-in Emacs function
[[helpfn:list][list]]. For that reason we need to use one of lists aliases.

One important note here. I first wrote [[helpfn:xl-report-error-advice][xl-report-error-advice]] as an around
advice that should be added to functions. The problem here is that sometimes I
advise compiled functions; and when I do, the variable =orig-fn= is bound to a
compiled function instead of a symbol. This is why this function has to
pre-emptively insert FN. A similar situation occurs with [[][generic expiring
advice]].

Instead of loading all features on startup, we want to load features only when
we need them--just in time. And by "just in time" I mean at the last possible
moment or in practice just before a function that uses this feature is called.
While I could use =defadvice!= for defining these advices, doing this would
quickly become repetative because it's something that is done so often in
package configuration. The function =before-call= and =after-call= provide a fast
and convenient way to do this.

*** idle-require
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0d619336-e852-4c6a-89a8-38ccbb71a077
:END:

Idle require is a tool for loading autoload functions, files or features during
idle time. The way to use this is to idle-require many small packages that
individually don't take too much time. This helps ensure that in emacs loading
of big packages like org-mode is snappy.

When emacs goes idle for [[helpvar:idle-require-idle-delay][idle-require-idle-delay]] seconds, the features will
start loading. [[helpvar:idle-require-load-break][idle-require-load-break]] is the break between features idle
require loads.

=idle-require= messages us to tell us when a package is being idle required and
when it has finished idle-requiring packages. I don't want to see the message
unless I'm debugging.

Since we're evaluating a good amount of lisp expressions, we should boost
garbage collection during this time.

Setting the font correctly and well is crucial for your efficiency while using

setting the font size.

Make sure to appropriately update [[helpvar:default-frame-alist][default-frame-alist]] when changing font size.

size to its default value.

After you type a key, emacs echoes it into the echo area. I find this
unnecessary. Additionally, this will interfere with [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]]. The keystroke

I find it convenient to be able to view the init time in the =*xl-log*=

If you just set [[helpvar:inhibit-startup-echo-area-message][inhibit-startup-echo-area-message]] to =t= the word =nil= is
messaged.  So it's best just to override the function entirely.

As per [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18677/prevent-auto-save-list-directory-to-be-created][this stackoverflow question]], this prevents the =auto-save-directory= from

Emacs garbage collects too frequently for most modern machines. This makes emacs
less performant especially when performing a large number of calculations,
because it spends resources garbage collecting when it doesn't have to. Indeed,
increasing the value of [[helpvar:gc-cons-threshold][gc-cons-threshold]], the number of bytes of consing
between garbage collections, is known to make a notable difference in user
startup time. By default it is only 800 KB.

are done before setting the =gc-cons-threshold= back to a normal value.

***** minibuffer

:END:

[[helpvar:minibuffer-setup-hook][minibuffer-setup-hook]] and [[helpvar:minibuffer-exit-hook][minibuffer-exit-hook]] are the hooks run just before
entering and exiting the minibuffer (respectively). In the minibuffer I'll be
primarily doing searches for variables and functions. There are alot of
variables and functions so this can certainly get computationally expensive. To
keep things snappy I increase boost the [[helpvar:gc-cons-threshold][gc-cons-threshold]] just before I enter
the minibuffer, and restore it to it's original value a few seconds after it's closed.

It would take me forever to guess the name =minibuffer-setup-hook= from the
variable [[helpvar:minibuffer-exit-hook][minibuffer-exit-hook]]. If I knew the name =minibuffer-exit-hook= but did not
know what the hook to enter the minibuffer was, I'd probably
=minibuffer-enter-hook= because [[https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-opposite-of/exit.html]["enter" is one of the main antonyms of "exit"]].
It'd take me forever to guess =startup=. Note that the only tricky thing about
this example.

At first I thought of =entry= but after more thought I realized
hook variables use action verbs in their names not nouns. So the =exit= in
=minibuffer-exit-hook= is actually the verb =exit= not the noun.

If you don't enable =custom-save-themes=, emacs asks you whether you're sure you

The goal is to efficiently setup the bindings we need to use Emacs. It's
important to remember that not matter how powerful the commands you have, if you
don't invest the time into binding them to useful keys you'll be very
inefficient, having to press =M-x= between any non built-in command. Its
important to bind them and to do it in an organized way so you can always find
the bindings you need when you need it.

This headline is concerned with the definition of =bind!=, a general purpose
mapping macro similar to [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/core/core-keybinds.el][doom's map macro]], [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-bind-map][bind-map]], and [[https://github.com/priyadarshan/bind-key][bind]] used in
use-package (of these though it is most similar to doom's macro). The purpose is
to provide a versatile, non-repetative, and extensible syntax that does what I
mean. Overall I want to abstract the act of keybinding and to not concern myself
with the automatable (not a word probably) details of binding keys.

**** evil key to states

:END:

I want to specify evil states via keywords just like Doom Emacs's =map!=
macro. So, for example =:nm= in front of a binding would mean the binding should
be bound in =normal= and =motion= state. The reason for doing this is that (1)
it is more concise than naming the actual states and (2) it allows us to specify
bindings of different states in the same form as opposed to [[helpfn:evil-define-key*][evil-define-key*]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

As it stands =define-key= and friends raise an error if the keymap you specified

These leaders are specifically for evil mode states (not including insert and
Emacs). I choose the space (=SPC=) key for evil leaders because it is one of if
not the easiest key to press because of its central placement on the keyboard
and its sheer size--at least on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY][qwerty]] keyboard that I use. The choice
of =SPC m= for the major mode specific keys is simply for the pnemonic =m= which
stands for "major mode". The short major mode prefix key =,= is for cases when I
want to shorten a key binding. Although obviously not as easy to remember as
=m=, it provides me with one shorter keypress in certain situations.

Creating a minor mode to hold the leader map allows us to toggle our leader
bindings on or off.

Enabling =override-mode= needs to be the first thing we do in

keybindings like evil. Otherwise, your bindings might not take effect
immediately. This is why I set the advice dept to =-100=.

The whole point of the leader bindings is that they be available everywhere and
at all times. Accordingly, we want to ensure our leaders and all their child

To ensure that =xl-override-mode-map= takes priority over evil states, we need
to make it an intercept map for all evil states. In evil, intercept maps are
maps that take priority (intercept) evil bindings when they have a different

override an evil keymap).

=*Messages*=). Instead, they will only work after you switch states once.

Emacs is full of so many keybindings, that it can be difficult to keep track of
them. Especially when you're starting out, but even when you're an Emacs-pro,
it's easy to forget what a particular functionality is bound to. Typically,
you'll remember the first few key strokes but struggle with the rest. To address
this [[github:][which-key]] displays key binding sequences in the minibuffer as your typing
them. By doing this you can "discover" the commands as you go along.

One of the most common--if not the most common--command you use in Emacs is
[[helpfn:execute-extended-command][execute-extended-command]]. This command let's you search any other command and
upon pressing enter, then you execute the command. The fact that this command is
invoked so frequently suggests it should have one of the shortest, easiest to
press bindings. I chose to give it =SPC SPC= and =;=. =SPC SPC= is short and
quick to type as well as consistent with other =SPC= bindings. While =;= is
super fast to press as well and even faster than =SPC SPC=.

In this headline I focus on packages that perform completion on a set of
candidates. These candidates may either be in the minibuffer or as text to
complete.

:END:

Selectrum is another completion framework. It distinguishes itself from the rest
by striving to work with the built-in emacs [[helpfn:completing-read][completing-read]] instead of replacing
it like [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][ivy]] do. It promises to work with the existing Emacs framework
instead of replacing it as does Ivy and Helm. :recycle:

**** selectrum
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6e670980-7794-4505-a285-184416a5b377
:END:

In contrast, any command defined via completing-read should work consistently with
selectrum and its provided features.

Because helm and ivy replace the existing framework, it means that whenever you
want a command be capable of using all of helm or ivy's features, you need to
define it their way. Otherwise, there's no guarantee their features will work at
least any features besides the basic choosing of a single candidate. That's a
big reason why there are helm and ivy packages (there's 216 helm packages and 42
ivy packages in [[helpfn:straight-use-package][straight-use-package]] completion): many of those packages are just ivy and
helm wrappers around existing commands.

When the variable [[helpvar:selectrum-show-indices][selectrum-show-indices]] is set to this function, selectrum
displays letters starting at =a= to [[helpvar:selectrum-num-candidates-displayed][selectrum-num-candidates-displayed]] times
down the alphabet. Fun fact, I actually contributed this feature to selectrum. :confetti-ball:

*** helm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2da24557-b05d-475e-8565-6a24e23309c0
:END:

The reason I have helm installed is because (1) helm has some useful functions
that are not yet implemented for other completion frameworks and (2) selectrum
has a [[helpfn:selectrum-helm-mode][selectrum-helm-mode]] which it can use to "selectrumify" helm functions--at
least to some extent (sometimes the default action doesn't work).

It seems like I may be able to add default actions via an advice. :shrug-tone4:
We'll see. Basically, the idea would be to take reuse the code of helm commands
for presenting candidates and then make the action selection work via an advice
and, of course, add multiple actions via [[id][embark]].

Oh and in regards for using selectrum instead of helm: the main reason is simply
that helm is noticably slower with its command filtering. :turtle:

If you're scrolling down a list of candidates, you might be suprised to
find. One "gotcha" in helm is the [[helpvar:helm-candidate-number-limit][helm-candidate-number-limit]]. By default helm
limits the amount of candidates it displays to increase performace.

Selectrum has no problem handling a large amount of candidates, particularly if
you additionally pause garbage collection for the duration of expensive
functions as I do. It handles the 16,143 candidates in [[helpfn:helm-system-packages][helm-system-packages]] on
my T400 instantaneously.

:END:

This package provides a way of adding actions (think helm) to commands. The
special thing about it is a generic way to do so.

The idea of actions is to minimize code duplication. The scenario is this: you
have an existing commands that allows you to select a candidate from a prompt
and do =X= with a candidate =c= from the set of candidates =C=. You want to
select from the same prompt, but instead you want to do =Y= with =c= not =X=. So
what do you do? You're faced with rewriting the command, copying the code for
the prompt and adding the code to do =Y= (with something like =helm= you'd
rewrite the code in terms of sources and actions). That's a lot of work!
:tired-face: And it's not scalable either you'd need to do this for any other
commands you come accross in the future. This explains why there are so many
=helm= packages.

=embark= provides a way to add actions to an existing command without having to
rewrite it.

Honestly, reading it's documentation can be a bit dizzying :dizzy-face:; not
because the it's bad but because it is hard to wrap your mind around such a
package without seeing it in action.

There is a need to save buffers and window configurations in their own groups.
Often we'll have a group of buffers we've setup to work on a project or task and
suddenly, in the middle of that task we'll want to work on another task. It's
inconvenient to get rid of the window configuration we've set up just to have to
come back to it and set it up again. This is what workspaces, also called
workgroups, are for. You can save the window configuration you're using and
switch to a new one.

Workgroup provides a. One notable advantage of workgroups is that it does not
use emacs's built-in serialization of window configs. Usually, it is better to
use something that's built-in. However, emacs's serialization has the drawback
that it's not a lisp object; implying that it is not.

[[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] (Emacs X-Window Manager) is a full-featured window manager in Emacs.  There
are benefits and drawbacks to making emacs your window manager. One benefit is
that you get a super consistent window management experience. One drawback is
that if Emacs hangs or crashes you need to restart your computer.

A common dream among many Org users is to integrate [[info:org#Capture][org-capture]] into their browser.
Indeed, the browser by nature would be a place you'd want to capture from a lot.
However, since graphical browsers are not in emacs the main way to do this was
via a hacky and difficult to set up [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]].

The dream is to do all text editing in Emacs. This package is a big step towards
achieving that dream. =exwm-edit= allows the user to edit text fields in
external packages with an emacs buffer. It acts a lot like =org-edit-src-code=:
it copies any text in the text field to a buffer, you edit the buffer, then
press a binding to insert the buffer text into the text field. It goes without
saying that when the text is in an emacs buffer, you can use the full-force of
Emacs's text editing capabilities on it.

To avoid losing information. You should commit often in git--like every 10
seconds or so. Obviously doing this manually on the command line (or even on

Committing often as I recommend will inevitably result with commits that are
many bits and pieces of a change. The idea is to then squash together all
related commits for the "polished" result. With this function I create "smart"
commit messages that take advantage of the org headline structure. This makes it
easy to go back and group commits which are related. Note that this function
fails when you have a change that spans across multiple headlines (such as the
replacement of a name throughout a document). This is something I plan to
address later.

:ID:       684e788c-6db9-4e6e-826b-d4871c0a3f90
:END:

The default auto-saving feature in emacs saves after a certain number of
characters are typed (see [[helpvar:auto-save-interval][auto-save-interval]]). The problem is that if you're in
the middle of typing and you've just hit the number of characters that trigger a
save, you could experience a lag, particularly if you are dealing with a large
file being saved. Instead of doing this, [[https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save][super-save]] saves buffers during idle
time and after certain commands like [[helpfn:switch-to-buffer][switch-to-buffer]] (see [[helpvar:super-save-triggers][super-save-triggers]]).
Note that this is the same strategy employed by [[id:c550f82a-9608-47e6-972b-eca460015e3c][idle-require]] to load packages.
Saving files like this reduces the likelihood of user delays.

This headline contains customizations and extensions to =edit-indirect= so that I
can use it to edit org descriptions in the same way that we edit source blocks.

There are two cases when editing a description. There's the case of an existing
description and there's the case of a new one.

It is my preference to have one blank line after a description--or any org item
for that matter. I just find it much more readable and less cluttered.

=edit-indirect= has hooks for whenever you want to do a quick thing.

***** goto last non-white
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f9afdc3d-ceea-4e9e-a986-9f6bb7e860f6
:END:

Most of the time I will want to add to the end of a description. Therefore, I
want the cursor to start at the last non-whitespace character of the
description.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-edit-paragraph:goto-last-non-white ()
  (goto-char (point-max))

***** add newlines in the beginning
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       46917f50-8e0b-4c29-8f9b-1aab7e0e9550
:END:

In the case where there was no existing description, we need to add newlines to
the description buffer so that if we end up committing a change the description
will be placed properly in relation to what's below it. This hook is designed to
make sure this happens.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-edit-paragraph:add-newlines ()
  "Add newlines."
  (save-excursion
    (--dotimes (1+ org-edit-paragraph:default-post-blanks)
      (insert "\n"))))

***** maybe remove newline
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cfa12a0f-fd23-4684-bb10-b86b2e4e5c58
:END:

When you open a description buffer and close it again, you'd expect the source
buffer to stay the same--and you should expect this. Since we add newlines to
the description buffer when there's no existing description, we could
inadvertently edit the source buffer in this case. So this hook is to remove any
newlines added in the case that nothing was changed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-edit-paragraph:maybe-remove-newline ()
  "Remove newline if that's all there is."
  (when (and (seq-every-p (fn! (= 10 <>)) (buffer-string))
	     (= (1+ org-edit-paragraph:default-post-blanks) (length (buffer-string))))
    (erase-buffer)))

**** define a minor mode for editing descriptions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8775acdc-0389-40af-a5f4-e74c78144944
:END:

The way I've set things up editing descriptions is it's own "thing". I'm going
to be adding hooks and maybe even binding keys with editing descriptions in mind.
Therefore, I think it's worthy to give it it's own mode.

**** requirements for editing descriptions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9a789e79-84b8-4415-b152-e11fca786587
:END:

The edit description function requires =org-ml= and =edit-indirect=. I don't
know if this is the best way to declare these dependencies. It certaintly is
efficient.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:

It is uncough to edit the text of the buffer when we're not commit it--even
worse to have to edit it again afterwards if we don't end up committing
anything. No, instead we should work with the edit indirect buffer.

We need to make sure that we respect [[helpvar:edit-indirect-after-creation-hook][edit-indirect-after-creation-hook]] by doing
our description management stuff before anything is done in that hook. It may be
worth it to consider creating a hook specifically for org descriptions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

When I open a buffer for editing a description it is very likely that I'll end
up appending more commentary to the existing description. I think it will save

form: ~((CURSOR-SHAPE . CURSOR-WIDTH) COLOR)~.

***** colors and shapes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 3f3cd5c9-1f6d-4c3b-b73f-82c9ee00395e
:END:

Changing the cursor shape and color depending on the state is a convenient and
asthetically pleasing way of determining which state you're in. Some add some
modeline indicator for this but I find that the cursor suffices.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defhook! setup-cursor (evil-mode-hook)
  "Initialize the default cursor shape and size."
  (setq evil-insert-state-cursor   '((bar . 3)   "chartreuse3"))
  (setq evil-emacs-state-cursor    '((bar . 3)   "SkyBlue2"))
  (setq evil-normal-state-cursor   '( box        "DarkGoldenrod2"))
  (setq evil-visual-state-cursor   '((hollow)    "dark gray"))
  (setq evil-operator-state-cursor '((hbar . 10) "hot pink"))

After a theme is loaded, the cursor color won't automatically update. Therefore,
I add a hook in [[helpvar:xl-after-load-theme-hook][xl-after-load-theme-hook]]. Now after a new theme is loaded, the
cursor color will update.

Before I just used ~(evil-change-state evil-previous-state)~ to revert the
state back to what it last was. But this fails with ~evil-force-normal-state~
which is what I'm currently using to exit the minibuffer because then the
last state is normal state if the minibuffer is aborted. Using a
=evil:state-before-minibuffer= ensures that the state will be reverted to
the correct one.

**** text objects
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0edef735-cec9-4015-bfd5-cf36e816cbc3
:END:

To edit text efficiently Vim has the concept of [[https://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/10/17/vim-text-objects-the-definitive-guide/][text objects]]. Text objects are
structures that are seen in text. For example, a set of words followed by a
period is a sentence. A words between two closing parentheses is a sexp.

***** general delimiter text object
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0066093b-7991-4193-8ce2-ef9f17af211a
:END:

I discovered this the =form= text object from using [[https://github.com/luxbock/evil-cleverparens][evil-cleverparens]] in the past.
The package =evil-cleverparens= was too slow for my taste; noctuid's [[https://github.com/sp3ctum/evil-lispy][evil-lispy]] is
much faster and gave me the functionality that I needed most from
=evil-cleverparens=: deleting and copying text with parentheses intelligently.
However, many of the ideas of =evil-cleverparens= were excellent. One particular
idea was to have a general =form= text object. Instead of specifying the
particular surrounding bounds when doing an evil operator command you just use a
single key for them. It's kind of like a =Do-What-I-Mean= surround operator. This
is suprisingly useful because it takes significant time to specify whether you
want =[]= or ={=}= or =()= or =""=. The main drawback you cannot distinguish between
surround characters at multiple levels--it just takes the closest one. In
practice, this is rarely an issue.

=Vim= and =Evil= both have the interesting (inconsistent?) behavior that doing an

selected instead of just "hello world".

Why not just go to the end of the ="= like any other around operator?

A problem with elisp indentation is indents quoted lists the way functions
should be indented. It has been discussed in at least three stackoverflow
questions [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10230/how-to-indent-keywords-aligned/10233#10233][here]], [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49222433/align-symbols-in-plist][here]] and [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22166895/customize-elisp-plist-indentation][here]]. In all these questions the solutions have not
been satisfactory. Some of them recommend using [[helpfn:common-lisp-indent-function][common-lisp-indent-function]] as
the value of [[helpvar:lisp-indent-function][lisp-indent-function]]. This works for indenting a quoted list
properly, but at the expense of changing the way that many other elisp forms are
indented. Common Lisp's indentation is different from Elisp's. Others recommend
using [[https://github.com/Fuco1/.emacs.d/blob/af82072196564fa57726bdbabf97f1d35c43b7f7/site-lisp/redef.el#L12-L94][Fuco1's lisp indent function hack]]. This also is not ideal. For one thing it
only works for quoted lists with keywords but not generic symbols. Another thing
is that the change should really be occurring in [[helpfn:calculate-lisp-indent][calculate-lisp-indent]].
~calculate-lisp-indent~ is a function that returns what the indentation should be
for the line at point. Since Fuco1 did not modify ~calculate-lisp-indent~ the
*wrong* indentation still returned by this function and the modified
~lisp-indent-function~ just cleans up the mess. Better is just fixing the source
of the problem. You can check out a more in-depth explanation looking at my
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/d7x7x8/finally_fixing_indentation_of_quoted_lists/][reddit-post]] or looking at an answer I gave to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10230/how-to-indent-keywords-aligned][this question]].

Sometimes you want to see what an object looks like represented as text so you
know what you're dealing with. For example, I've wanted to see what a straight

Note that I use points to store the heading points and go back to them inreverse
order. This is important because org does not unfold headlines properly if you
start from an invisible subheading.

Notably, I do not try to conserve the return value of =xl/goto-line= or
=xl/jump-to-headline= because these functions are and should only be used for
their side-effects.

In my eyes, many Org functions are unnecessarily complicated and long. Often they
need to perform a simple task (like inserting a heading) but lose their
fundamental purpose in their inclusion of numerous obscure and opinionated
options. For this reason I wrote my own insert heading functions.

The goal is to achieve, an agenda with only items in the time grid. There was a
[[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/15309/is-there-a-way-to-show-an-agenda-with-just-a-time-grid][question]] asked about this. This is theoretically possible by creating a
skip function that skips all items that aren't in the time frame of the grid.
Ideally, what we'd want is to use =org-ql=.

Fortunately, there's a function =org-= that takes a =POM= (point or marker)
which is perfect for getting the agenda.

The default org agenda display is pretty crude, particularly with several items.
To customize the default agenda view you can checkout
[[helpfvar:org-agenda-custom-commands][org-agenda-custom-commands]]. For sections of the agenda I suggest using
[[helpfn:org-ql-block][org-ql-block]]. It makes things easier and is likely much faster than the default
Emacs. In the future I want to divide these sections into their own function (or
variables?) so that I can easily piece together different agenda views.

having an extensible, fast, nice-looking dashboard when starting emacs is

use it as a launching point to get to your tasks quicker. And second, it doesn't
require any expensive modes. I've often been starting out with the scratch
buffer and I've wanted to have the scratch buffer start off with

Emacs can add border to windows using a mode called [[helpfn:window-divider-mode][window-divider-mode]].
Often in emacs you have multiple windows displaying different buffers on the
screen. By default the border between these windows is very thin, so it can be
hard to distinguish windows sometimes. The point of adding borders to windows is
to distinguish them easily from one another.

Window dividers are useful in general so I don't get confused about when one
window ends and another begins (see [[helpfn:window-divider-mode][window-divider-mode]]). When using [[I like emacs][exwm]] it
makes emacs feel like a window manager with gaps.

[[http://w3m.sourceforge.net/][w3m]] is a text-based web browser. There are many other text-based browsers out
there, but =w3m= has the benefit of having comprehensive [[https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m][emacs interface]]. Why
use this when you can use the GUI browser? Well, using the Emacs interface I can
view an Emacs webpage as plain text, which means I can perform searches on it
with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper.git][swiper]], or any other Emacs operation on it. Another advantage is that
because the w3m interface's backend is a terminal application, it will (I'm
guessing; no benchmarks made) typically be faster than browsers at rendering
plain text webpages. Of course, the main limitation is that w3m will typically
only display text based web pages well--not ones with lots of interactive
javascript code.

=mu4e= is the most popular Emacs email client--and for good reason. It's fast,
tag-based, and has great documentation. One annoying quirk for me is that unlike
all other Emacs packages it does not come uncoupled from the external program it
uses. What this means is that you need to tell Emacs where the mu4e =.el= files
are :pouting-cat:. It also means it's more difficult to incorporate it with the
contribution workflow that [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] encourages. I haven't figured out
how to automate this across multiple OSes.

This is annoying, but minor. =mu4e= itself is a great package.

This headline attempts to automate the initialization of mu4e. The goal is for
me to do as little as possible by (by which I mean nothing :joy:) to get a

If you don't set [[helpvar:dired-recursive-deletes][dired-recursive-deletes]], emacs will prompt you every time you
try to delete a directory asking you whether you want to recursively delete its
contents. If you're actually permenently deleting it this is a good idea to
prevent accidental deletion, but I set [[helpvar:delete-by-moving-to-trash][delete-by-moving-to-trash]] to =t=. So
worst case I'll accidentally move a directory to the trash folder.

This is an Emacs package for quickly navigating to a specific parent directory
in ~eshell~ without having to repeatedly typing ~cd ..~.

** shrink-path
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: bd21a69a-794c-4ff1-97d0-9e5911a26ad7
:END:

It's easy to underestimate how much of a difference having an asthetically
pleasing Emacs configuration can have. Ugliness really can take its toll.

** text scaling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5d242d0e-eeab-46de-bcee-ecfd79b2bffc
:END:

I change the text scale frequently because in some cases, such as viewing my
main org file, I want a birds-eye view where I can see the structure of a
document at a glance. However, when I'm doing something like editing a source
block I want to focus on a very specific thing totally; therefore, I want the
text to take up most of the screen.

*** zoom-frm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       15b8577e-3f98-420a-81a5-c7b91292aca3
:END:

This package increases or decreases the font of the current frame. It differs
from [[helpfn:text-scale-increase][text-scale-increase]] and [[helpfn:text-scale-decrease][text-scale-decrease]] in that it applies this
"zooming" to the whole frame instead of the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package zoom-frm
  :set
  (frame-zoom-font-difference . 0.5)
  (zoom-frame/buffer          . 'buffer))

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d3e15439-f690-4ced-b701-0882fb911a5c
:END:

This is a package that displays emojis! :D A major focus of my config is having
the ability to express myself well--in ways that is simply impossible with mere
documentation. This includes using emojis. Also, using emojis makes
documentation *much* more fun. :joy-cat:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emojify

  (emojify-emojis-dir . (concat XL-CACHE-DIR "emojis/")))
#+end_src

** info
:PROPERTIES:

This headline is for customizing info nodes.

** saveplace
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       41cb3357-9b4b-4205-987d-ff72f9a35df3
:END:

This package takes you to the last point you were at when you visited a file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** saveplace

:END:

As its name suggests, =save-place= is a built-in package that stores the buffer
location you left off at in a particular buffer. When you visit that buffer
again, you are taken to the location you left off. This is very convenient.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package saveplace
  :after-call after-find-file

** recentf
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5ab47c35-53bd-460f-ba41-6f3075bd1222
:END:

=recentf= is a built-in program that tracks the files you've opened recently
persistently. This is a great idea because these are the files you'll likely
revisit. In practice, I look at this list of files in addition to the buffers I
already have open using a [[id:f26bedb3-a172-4543-afd0-4c47f5872d15][completion-framework]]. Because of this I rarely
have to set out to look for a file with =dired=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  :idle-require easymenu tree-widget timer
  :hook (kill-emacs-hook . recentf-save-list)
