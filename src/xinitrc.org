Coming from a vim background and currently using [[git][evil]], I've come to rely on the
escape key heavily as a "quit everything" binding. I press it much more often
than the caps-lock key--actually I think I don't ever use the caps-lock
key. Even in emacs, there's [[https://github.com/emacs-straight/caps-lock][caps-lock]], so I'm not sure if I need it at all.

#+begin_src sh
setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape
#+end_src

* then load emacs

:END:

Obviously, we load our OS. In the future, I may use a display manager so I can
easily switch between emacs, stumpwm or any other window manager of my
choosing. I don't use the default display manager provied with =guix= because.

#+begin_src sh
exec emacs
#+end_src
