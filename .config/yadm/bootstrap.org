The purpose of this file is for bootstrapping my readme. And by this I mean,
tangle all the files I need.

I don't like writing elisp without using libraries like [[][dash]] and
[[][loopy]]. Some of the side-effects that I wrote in [[][my readme]] use these
libraries. So we do this first before tangling.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert-file-contents (expand-file-name "~/README.org"))
  ;; this is the id of the init.el.
  (re-search-forward "44daab3a-14bd-4c47-a117-88579e89a0e2" nil t nil)

  (org-babel-execute-subtree))

* tangle everything

:END:

In the future, I'll add prompts here so that I can interactively determine what
I'd like tangled. If I'm on a mac or windows computer, for example, I may not
want to tangle my stumpwm config. Then again, it's not a huge deal so we'll see.
