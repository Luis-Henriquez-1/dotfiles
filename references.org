The purpose of this file is contain references.

Let me explain. Often when I write descriptions for headlines I want to add
reference links. You might think "Ok, just add them in the description.". But
the thing is, that sometimes there are several and/or I don't want to discuss
every one of them. I was thinking of creating a separate drawer for them, but I
don't like the extra space it consumes and it does not work well with
[[https://github.com/][github]] and [[https://about.gitlab.com/][gitlab]] because they don't hide them.
