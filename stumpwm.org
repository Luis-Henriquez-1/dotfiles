[[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm][Stumpwm]] is a window manager written entirely in [[][common lisp]. Because
of this it is extensible in ways that other window managers can never be. I am
torn between this window manager and [[][exwm]. I've invested heavily in Emacs
and when using stumpwm there is a problem of compatibility between languages.
There is also an overlap problem.

The advantage stumwm has over exwm is that it is more resistant to crashing.
