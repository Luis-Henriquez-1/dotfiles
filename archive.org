I try to avoid deleting headlines. There's no reason to delete them if they
might prove useful later. This file will contain the headlines that for
some reason I'm not using.

You may wonder that if I'm using version control why have this file. Why not get
the headlines back searching my vcs history. Well, version control does not
"know" about org headlines. And I don't know of a way to search through it
painlessly.
